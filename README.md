# Automatic_Tollgate
I have created a automatic toll gate using arduino uno microcontroller 
## How it works
An arduino uno used in this project is coded in such a way that when an object(toy car) is placed at a certain distance from the ultrasonic sensor, the servo motor rotates 90 degrees and when the object is moved out the servo motor comes back to it's initial position.
